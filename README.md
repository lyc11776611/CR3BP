# Homework3 for AE502 Advance orbital mechanics

### scripts:

##### 1. Q1.py
This script contains main program to calculate problem 1 that use Lie-Hori transform to solve the problem.

##### 2. Q2.py
This script contains main program to calculate problem 2.

##### 3. Q3.py
This script generates random initial Kepler orbital elements to propagate and compare difference between Q1 method and 
Q2 method in equinocial variable.

##### 4. orbit_elements.py
This script contains all major functions for converting between different orbital elements as well as to cartesian coordinates.

##### 5. orbit_propagator.py
Contains functions used to solve the Lambert problem, not used in other script.

##### 6. Settings.py
Set a few constants in this file.


### Usage:
Change necessary parameters and run Q1.py/Q2.py/Q3.py directly.
